              time to work together.</strong

            We believe biotechnology will reshape our world in the decades to
            come, and that we must guide the coming changes with intention and
            forethought. At Catalyst, we aimed to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Bring together <strong>a broad range of people</strong> invested
              in the future of biotechnology, including synthetic biologists,
              policymakers, academics, and biohackers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Acknowledge that when it comes to questions this large, people of
              good faith can disagree, and to try to
              <strong>find common ground</strong> amidst those disagreements.
            </li>
            <li>
              Create a space for sharing perspectives, building connections, and

            We hope the Catalyst community will continue to work together to

            At Catalyst, we created an environment for around 100 participants
            to explore creative solutions to emerging biological risks. The
            summit featured a combination of conversations, workshops, talks,
            and structured problem-solving. It was free to attend for those
            accepted by application, and we provided travel support for a number
            of participants who required it, so that finances wouldn’t be an
            obstacle to attending.

            The summit started and ended in conversation. The Long Conversation
            format uses a relay of dialogues around a shared prompt, where each
            speaker has an unscripted, one-on-one conversation with the speaker
            before them, and then speaks with the next participant before
            rotating off. These conversations were:

            Every participant in Catalyst joined a small group for a guided

            biotechnology and society. These problems included:

            According to our exit survey, the participants found the design jam
            to be the most valuable part of day, aside from the conversations
            they had with each other.
