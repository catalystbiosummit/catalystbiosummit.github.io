							<h2>Biotechnology is moving fast.</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p><strong>You’ve heard the news:</strong> DNA synthesis and sequencing get
				            cheaper every year. Standardized biological parts and affordable tools mean that you
				            can engineer bacteria in your garage. Cultured meat is coming to a supermarket near you.
				            The first CRISPR babies will soon be learning to walk.</p>

							<h2>Many futures are possible.</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>It’s now easy to imagine a future where we eradicate diseases like malaria, manufacture
				            carbon-neutral plastics, and seed the deserts with drought-resistant crops. But we must
				            also consider futures that include runaway gene drive extinctions, laboratory accidents we
				            can't contain, and even the spread of engineered pathogens. We cannot launch new biotechnologies into the world and blindly hope they will disrupt it
				            for the better. <strong>We must thoughtfully, collaboratively and creatively face the consequences
				            of our innovation.</strong></p>

							<h2>Its time to work together</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Catalyst Biosummit will bring together synthetic biologists and policymakers, academics
					            and biohackers, and a broad range of professionals invested in biosecurity for a day of
					            collaborative problem-solving. We aim to catalyze a diverse community of forward-looking
					            individuals who will <strong>work together to engineer a future enhanced by biology and not
					            endangered by it.</strong>

							<h2>About the event</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>
								This is an experimental event that hopes to create a context for <strong>sharing perspectives, building connections, and sparking collaboration.</strong> Expect a mixture of lightning talks, workshops, and structured group problem-solving, as well as space and support for attendees to convene their own meetups and brainstorming sessions.

							<h2>The organizing team</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>Catalyst is being organized by a team of PhD students, early-career researchers, and biotechnology professionals, including the organizers behind the <a href="https://www.eastbaybiosecurity.org/">East Bay Biosecurity Group</a>. The conference is supported by a grant from the Effective Altruism <a href="https://app.effectivealtruism.org/funds/far-future">Long Term Future Fund</a>. We are being advised by <a href="https://cisac.fsi.stanford.edu/people/megan_palmer">Dr. Megan Palmer</a> and <strong>are currently seeking additional members for our advisory board.</strong> <a href="mailto:eastbaybiosec@gmail.com">Contact us</a> if you're interested.
