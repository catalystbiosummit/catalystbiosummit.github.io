            Biotechnology is moving fast. You’ve heard the news: DNA synthesis and sequencing get
            cheaper every year. Standardized biological parts and affordable tools mean that you
            can engineer bacteria in your garage. Cultured meat is coming to a supermarket near you.
            The first CRISPR babies will soon be learning to walk.

            It’s now easy to imagine a future where we eradicate diseases like malaria, manufacture
            carbon-neutral plastics, and seed the deserts with drought-resistant crops. But we must
            also consider futures that include runaway gene drive extinctions, laboratory accidents we
            can't contain, and even the spread of engineered pathogens.
        </p>

            We cannot launch new biotechnologies into the world and blindly hope they will disrupt it
            for the better. We must thoughtfully, collaboratively and creatively face the consequences
            of our innovation.

            Catalyst Biosummit will bring together synthetic biologists and policymakers, academics
            and biohackers, and a broad range of professionals invested in biosecurity for a day of
            collaborative problem-solving. We aim to catalyze a diverse community of forward-looking
            individuals who will work together to engineer a future enhanced by biology and not
            endangered by it.
